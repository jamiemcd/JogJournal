Jog Journal
==========

An iOS demo app for recording jog data. I coded this as part of my screening process with [Toptal](http://www.toptal.com/resume/jamie-mcdaniel).

The app demostrates my skill-set with:

* iOS 7.0 SDK
* UIKit and Auto layout
* Core Data
* Core Location
* Parse iOS SDK
* Writing clean code
